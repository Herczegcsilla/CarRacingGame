# CarRacingGame
My first computer graphics project in OpenGL. A car drives around a track and must reach the finish line before time is up, while collecting small, golden clocks to give the player more time to get to the finish. I was under serious time constraints so this game is not 100% finished. The camera does not yet follow the car and there are also some other things I am not happy with but I thought it went well for a first attempt at graphics programming.
